## Introduction

_What is a Node.js_ <https://nodejs.org/en>

Node.jsÂ® is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts.

`node -v`: Displays the currently installed version of Node.js.

**REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**: An interactive shell for running and testing Node.js code line by line.

## JavaScript - A Quick Refresher

**Callback:** A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function

**Synchronous:** executes code line by line, blocking further execution until the current task completes.

**Asynchronous:** allows code to run without blocking, enabling tasks like API calls or timers to complete in the background.

**Promises:** A Promise is an Object that links Producing code and Consuming code

- _Producing code_ is code that can take some time
- _Consuming code_ is code that must wait for the result

**Async/Await:** async and await make promises easier to write

- _async_ makes a function return a Promise
- _await_ makes a function wait for a Promise
